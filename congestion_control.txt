The difference between fast retransmit/ recovery is: window size stay static
in fast retransmit, while w = w + 1 for each dup ack is received. So fast
recovery is better. 

Global variable: 
threshold = 50 or etc
timeout: length of the timer of each packet 
         scale in seconds(5-10 s), while RTT scale in ms

SS
1. w = 1
2. w = w + 1 upon receiving one ack
3. if (w > threshold and not yet time out): enter AIMD or FAST
    Note: time out is the only way to get out of AIMD or FAST, 
4. if (time out): set threshold = threshold / 2
                  retransmit the time out packet 
                  go back to 1.

AIMD
1. w = w + 1/w for every ack
2.1 if received 3 dup acks: enter fast retransmit/fast recovery
Fast Retransmit:
    i) w = w / 2
    ii) for every 3 dup acks received, resend the lost packet(no matter the window size)
    iii) if window size is allowed, we can send new packet
    iv) once new ack is received, go back to AIMD.1
Fast Recovery:
    i) w = w / 2 (only happen once at the beginning)
    ii) for every 3 dup acks received, resend the lost packet(no matter the window size)
    *iii)* for each additional acks after the 3rd dup ack, w = w + 1
    iv) if window size is allowed, we can send new packet
    v) once new ack is received, set w = w / 2 and go back to AIMD.1
2.2 if time out happen at any of this, go back to SS.1

TCP Vegas
Exactly the same as AIMD except for step 1.
1. For every RTT:
    if W/RTTmin - W/RTT  < alpha then W++
    if W/RTTmin - W/RTT  > alpha then W--

FAST TCP
Exactly the same as AIMD except for step 2
1. periodically:
    W = (baseRTT/RTT) * W + alpha
    
I'm not very sure about FAST TCP, and TCP vegas makes more sense to me. Either one
will work.
